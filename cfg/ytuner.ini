[Radiobrowser]
;Enables support for radio-browser.info . 1-Yes 0-No ; Default = 1
Enable=1

;Radio-browser.info API URL. Default = http://all.api.radio-browser.info ; 
;Warning! Using an IP address instead of a domain name results in faster performance, however, such a domain IP address may change 
;and result in loss of connection to radio-browser.info. It is always worth checking the current list of servers at: http://all.api.radio-browser.info/json/servers
RBAPIURL=http://all.api.radio-browser.info

;Radio-browser.info most popular stations limit. Default = 100
;Warning! Due to the filtering functionality (since YTuner version 1.1.0) performed by the client side, this value means the number of stations got from radiobrowser-info and later optionally filtered out by YTuner. 
;For this reason, the station list displayed by AVR may be significantly different from this value or even be empty.
;Determine this value for yourself based on your filtering scope.
;Applicable for [catNone,ctFile,ctMemStr] RBCacheType only.
RBPopularAndSearchStationsLimit=100

;Radio-browser.info minimum number of stations per category. Default = 1
;Applicable for [catNone,ctFile,ctMemStr] RBCacheType only.
RBMinStationsPerCategory=1

;Radio-browser.info UUIDs file cache TTL (hours) ; Empty or value < 0 always means a valid UUID file cache (if exists) and never refreshes its content. ; Default = empty
;Applicable for [catNone,ctFile,ctMemStr] RBCacheType only.
RBUUIDsCacheTTL=

;Radio-browser.info UUIDs file cache auto refresh. Applicable when RBUUIDsCacheTTL>0 only. 1-Yes 0-No ; Default = 0
;Applicable for [catNone,ctFile,ctMemStr] RBCacheType only.
RBUUIDsCacheAutoRefresh=0

;Use one value of set [catNone,catFile,catMemStr,catDB,catMemDB,catPermMemDB] or leave blank.
;catNone or blank = Do not use cache. Slow! 
;catFile      = Store previously browsed categories and stations in cache files. Most suitable if the amount of free memory is very small.
;catMemStr    = Store previously browsed categories and stations in memory cache. FASTEST, but may need more bytes of free memory.
;catDB        = Store ALL useful information about categories and stations of Radio-browser.info in SQLite DB file.
;               The initial DB file creation process may take a few minutes, but will remain persistent after you restart YTuner.
;               After this operation, you will no longer need access to redio-browser.info until you decide to refresh the downloaded data (when RBCacheTTL>0).
;               Keep RBCacheTTL = 0 to prevent the DB file from being rebuilt after the RBCacheTTL time expires.
;catMemDB     = Same as catDB, but the entire database is placed in memory. This solution is NOT permanent and once YTuner is down all data will be lost.
;catPermMemDB = Combination of catMemDB+catDB; The entire database is placed in memory, but it is also saved to a file and remains persistent. The best option if you have valid sqlite3 driver.
;Windows users can get sqlite3.dll driver from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html . Linux / Unix (Solaris, BSD) / macOS users should have such a driver already installed in their OS. 
;Pay attention to "DBLibFolderLocation" parameter in "Configuration" section of this ini file.
;catMemDB and catPermMemDB require additional ~30MB of free RAM to load entire database. Refreshing the database involves starting a concurrent thread that downloads the current content of the radio-browser.info resources and creates a second database while the current one is still running.
;After the process is completed, the newly created database becomes the current database and the old one is deleted. Due to this, an additional ~30MB of free memory is needed for the duration of this process.
;Additionally, data in JSON format downloaded from Radio-browser.info takes over 50MB.
;
;Tip : If you are running YTuner on a machine that does not have much computing power and you have selected one of the options [catDB,catMemDB,catPermMemDB], the process of creating a full database of all stations from Radiobrowser.info may take a very long time.
;In such a case, it is better to run YTuner on a faster machine that will quickly build the rb.db file in the db directory and then copy this file to the appropriate directory on the YTuner machine.
;Regardless, the database itself may also be slow if your CPU does not have enough computing power.
;
;Test the best option for you. Default : Slow devices = catMemStr ; Fast devices = catPermMemDB;
RBCacheType=catPermMemDB

;Radio-browser.info stations cache TTL (hours). Empty or value < 0 always means a valid cache (if exists) and never refreshes its contents. ; Default = empty
